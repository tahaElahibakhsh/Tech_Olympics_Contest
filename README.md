# 🏆 Technology Olympiad – Final Tasks (October 2025)

This repository contains our solutions to the **final round challenges** of the **Technology Olympiad 2025**, held in **October 2025** in collaboration with **Quera**.

We proudly achieved **Rank 21 nationwide** among top teams. 🚀

The competition focused on real-world machine learning problems, combining data science, engineering, and creative modeling.

## 📌 Task 1 — TeaOverflowError

### Problem Overview

HonkHonk is a ride-hailing company in New York that used a highly complex proprietary pricing function (~3500 lines of code). Unfortunately, the only copy of this function was destroyed after an unfortunate tea accident ☕🔥.

The company now needs a **new dynamic pricing system**, trained purely from historical trip data generated by the original system.

Your mission: **reconstruct the pricing logic using machine learning.**

---

### Dataset

Each row represents a completed trip.

| Column                                  | Description                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                                    | Unique trip identifier                                   |
| `pickup_datetime`                       | Start time of the trip                                   |
| `dropoff_datetime`                      | End time of the trip                                     |
| `passenger_count`                       | Number of passengers                                     |
| `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`   | Pickup location                                          |
| `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude` | Dropoff location                                         |
| `store_and_fwd_flag`                    | Whether data was stored before forwarding (Y/N)          |
| `trip_duration`                         | Trip duration (seconds)                                  |
| `total_price`                           | **Target variable** – Final trip price (USD, train only) |

---

### Objective

Build a **dynamic pricing model** using:

* Feature engineering
* Machine learning / AI techniques
* Optional external data (e.g., weather, time patterns)

The model must predict `total_price` for unseen trips.

---

### Evaluation Metric

Performance is measured using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**, converted into a nonlinear score:

```
Score = 100 × exp(- RMSE / std(Y_true))
```

* **Score = 100** → Perfect predictions
* Lower RMSE relative to natural data variance earns higher scores

During the competition:

* Public score = evaluation on **30%** of test data
* Final score = evaluation on remaining **70%** (post-competition)

This setup prevents overfitting and rewards generalizable models.

---

### Submission

Participants worked inside a provided notebook and generated a `result.zip` file containing predictions.

## ⚡ Task 2 — Power Grid Crisis (Predictive Maintenance)

### Problem Overview

AeroGen Dynamics operates large-scale wind farms. The most critical and expensive component of each turbine is the **G‑78 planetary gearbox**. Unexpected failures cause:

* Weeks of downtime
* Repairs costing hundreds of thousands of dollars
* Cascading damage to other components

The company wants to move from **scheduled maintenance** to **predictive maintenance**, using operational sensor data to forecast failures before they happen.

Your mission: **classify the operational risk level of each turbine.**

---

### Risk Classes

Each turbine snapshot must be classified into one of five risk levels:

| Class | Meaning                                |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Low risk – Healthy operation           |
| 1     | Early warning – Monitor closely        |
| 2     | Medium risk – Schedule inspection      |
| 3     | High risk – Immediate inspection       |
| 4     | Critical – Imminent failure, shut down |

---

### Key Data Characteristics

* **Anonymized features:** Sensor identities and meanings are hidden — patterns must be learned directly from data.
* **Histogram-based sensors:** Some sensors appear as multiple columns (e.g., `166_0`, `166_1`, ...) representing bins of a distribution rather than single scalar values.
* **Time-to-event labeling:** Risk class depends on how close the turbine is to gearbox failure in operational time steps.

Class definitions based on remaining time before failure:

| Remaining Time Steps | Class |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| > 48                 | 0     |
| 48–24                | 1     |
| 24–12                | 2     |
| 12–6                 | 3     |
| 6–0                  | 4     |

---

### Dataset Structure

#### Training Set

* `train_operational_data.csv` – Full sensor history for turbines
* `train_specifications.csv` – Static turbine component types
* `train_tte.csv` – Total operational lifetime and failure indicators

#### Validation Set

* `validation_operational_data.csv` – Partial histories
* `validation_specifications.csv`
* `validation_labels.csv` – True class labels for final readings

#### Test Set

* `test_operational_data.csv`
* `test_specifications.csv`

---

### Objective

For each turbine in the test set, predict a single:

```
vehicle_id, class_label
```

Sorted by ascending `vehicle_id` and saved as `submission.csv`.

---

### Evaluation

Models are scored using a **custom reward–penalty cost matrix** that heavily penalizes:

* Missing critical failures
* Classifying high-risk turbines as healthy

Final score:

```
Final Score = 100 × max(0, Raw Score) / Maximum Possible Score
```

Like Task 1:

* Public leaderboard = 30% of test set
* Final ranking = remaining 70%

This enforces robustness and discourages overfitting.
